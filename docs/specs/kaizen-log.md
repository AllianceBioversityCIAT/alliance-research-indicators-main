## Active Lessons

| ID | Lesson | Severity | Target | Recurrence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **K-001** | A lint script that auto-fixes cannot serve as a verification gate — it makes the thing it checks true as a side effect of checking it | **High** | Product | 1 | Proposed |
| **K-002** | A tier can be certified "green" while being type-checked by nothing at all; test-runner green ≠ compiles | **High** | Product | 1 | Proposed |
| **K-003** | Correction-closure sweeps must grep the **literal superseded string**, then re-grep to confirm — semantic greps miss their own target | **High** | Methodology | 3 (within one spec) | Proposed (upstream) |

### 2026-08-13 — `bilateral/toc-optional-mapping`

**Outcome:** 10 tasks, 13 commits, all requirements covered. `/akili-test` PASS. `/akili-validate` **FAIL** (evidence trail, not code). Not archived clean — gaps explicitly accepted.

#### Measure

| Signal | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reviewer FAIL verdicts | 6 |
| Pivot Records | **2** — both for defects in the *approved spec*, not the implementation |
| HALTs / FATAL_FAILs | 0 |
| Rework attempts consumed | 0 of 3 on 8 tasks; 1 of 3 on T-06 and T-10 |
| Validation verdict | FAIL — 8 must-close items |
| **Budget breach** | **1,719 insertions vs ~530 estimated (3.2×)**; review rounds ≥14 vs 10. **`design.md` §9 required escalation; none was raised** |
| Leader errors caught by the panel | **3** (D8 false strike; two failed closure sweeps) |

**Notable:** the two Pivots and all three Leader errors were caught by *independent review*, not by the Leader. The review panel was the load-bearing control in this run.

#### Learn

**K-001 — `npm run lint` is `eslint --fix`, so it cannot verify.** Every "lint clean" report across ~10 tasks was an artifact: the command rewrote the working tree and exited 0, while the **committed branch failed Prettier** from T-04 onward. Undetected for the entire run; found only by independent validation feeding `HEAD` content through `eslint --stdin`.
*Root cause:* a verification gate whose action mutates the artifact it checks.
*Evidence:* `validation-report.md` F-2; remediation commit `2de57099`.
*Target:* **Product**.

**K-002 — the client tier was certified green without any type-check.** Client Jest runs `isolatedModules: true` (no type-checking) and the flat ESLint config ignores `*.spec.ts`. So **6,239 passing tests coexisted with a client build that fails `TS2345`**. The spec *recorded both facts itself* (T-07 advisory A-1; T-10's lint caveat) and stopped one inference short of the conclusion they force. `build` appears in no verification matrix.
*Root cause:* suite-green treated as compile-green; no gate distinguished them.
*Evidence:* `validation-report.md` FAIL-2.
*Target:* **Product**.

**K-003 — correction-closure sweeps failed three times in one spec.** After each Pivot the sweep reported *"every surviving instance corrected"*; each time instances survived (six after the first, three after the second, one after the third). One survivor, `execution.md:352`, **directly contradicted the corrected record 75 lines below it in the same file**.
*Root cause:* semantic/pattern greps miss the literal target — one reviewer's own filter excluded lines containing "false", which is the word inside *"returning `false`"*. Compounded by reporting closure without re-grepping.
*Evidence:* T-06 audit findings; `validation-report.md` F-1.
*Target:* **Methodology** — AKILI's *Correction Closure* rule says grep the superseded **value**; the lesson is grep the **literal string** and **re-grep to confirm**. Recommend upstreaming.

#### Standardize

| Lesson | Proposed minimal edit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| K-001 | `server/researchindicators/src/CLAUDE.md` §11 — note `npm run lint` is `eslint --fix` and **cannot** verify; use `npx eslint` (no `--fix`) as the gate | **Awaiting approval** |
| K-002 | `client/research-indicators/src/CLAUDE.md` — record that tests are neither linted nor type-checked (`isolatedModules: true`, ESLint ignores `*.spec.ts`), so `npm run build` is the only client type gate | **Awaiting approval** |
| K-003 | No local edit — Methodology lesson for upstreaming to the AKILI repo | Recorded |

#### What went right, worth preserving

- **`author ≠ auditor` was the load-bearing control.** Every substantive defect — two undischargeable ACs, duplicate-coverage-as-new-proof, and all three Leader errors — was found by an independent reviewer.
- **The two structural discharges are a reusable pattern:** unchanged-artifact argument + falsifiable lapse condition + a binding prohibition on naming tests as though they proved the discharged half. Independently re-derived and upheld at validation.
- **Pivots cost zero rework attempts**, as designed. Both spec defects were caught before burning the 3-attempt ceiling.
